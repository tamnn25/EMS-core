## 🧱 1️⃣ Core Java Foundations (Must-Know)

**Goal:** Write clean, correct Java without guessing.

### Topics to master

* Data types, operators
* Control flow (if, switch, loops)
* Methods & parameters
* Classes & objects
* `static` vs instance
* `final`, `this`, `super`

### Practice

* Rewrite small programs without IDE help
* Predict output before running code

---

## 🧬 2️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming (VERY IMPORTANT)

**This separates juniors from professionals**

### Master these deeply:

* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction
* Interfaces vs abstract classes
* Composition > inheritance

### Practice ideas

* Employee / Department system
* Payment methods (strategy pattern)
* Refactor code to remove duplication

---

## 🧵 3️⃣ Strings, Immutability & Memory

Many Java devs are weak here.

### Learn:

* String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer
* Immutability
* Heap vs Stack
* Garbage Collection basics
* Pass-by-value (critical!)

---

## 📦 4️⃣ Collections Framework (CORE SKILL)

You must know **when and why** to use each.

### Master:

* List, Set, Map
* ArrayList vs LinkedList
* HashMap vs TreeMap vs LinkedHashMap
* HashSet vs TreeSet
* `equals()` & `hashCode()` (VERY important)

### Practice

* Build frequency counters
* Cache implementation
* Remove duplicates efficiently

---

## ⚠️ 5️⃣ Exceptions & Error Handling

### Learn:

* Checked vs unchecked exceptions
* `try-catch-finally`
* Custom exceptions
* Best practices (don’t swallow exceptions)

---

## 🧵 6️⃣ Multithreading & Concurrency (Core Level)

Even basic knowledge makes you stand out.

### Focus on:

* Thread lifecycle
* `Runnable` vs `Thread`
* `synchronized`
* `volatile`
* `ExecutorService`
* Race conditions & deadlocks

---

## 🧰 7️⃣ Java 8+ Features (MANDATORY)

Modern Java = functional style.

### Must master:

* Lambda expressions
* Functional interfaces
* Streams API
* `Optional`
* Method references

### Practice

* Replace loops with streams
* Stream pipelines (map, filter, reduce)

---

## 📁 8️⃣ File I/O & NIO

### Learn:

* File, Path, Files
* Reading/writing text & JSON
* Serialization basics

---

## 🧪 9️⃣ Testing (Core Professional Skill)

### Learn:

* JUnit 5
* Assertions
* Unit vs integration tests
* Mocking basics (Mockito)

---

## 🧠 10️⃣ Think Like a Java Engineer

### Develop habits:

* Read JDK source code
* Understand *why*, not just *how*
* Write small utilities from scratch
* Refactor old code

---

## 🗓️ 90-Day Practical Plan

### Daily (1–1.5 hrs)

* 30 min theory
* 45 min coding
* 15 min review

### Monthly focus

* Month 1: OOP + Collections
* Month 2: Streams + Exceptions + Memory
* Month 3: Concurrency + Testing + Refactoring

---

## ✅ How to Know You’ve “Mastered” Core Java

You can:
✔ Explain concepts simply
✔ Choose the right collection automatically
✔ Debug without panic
✔ Write clean, testable code
✔ Understand others’ Java code easily

## 📌 Next Step (Very Important)

If you want, I can:

* Create a **daily Java practice plan**
* Give **real interview-style questions**
* Review your **Java code** and improve it
* Build a **mini Java project roadmap**
